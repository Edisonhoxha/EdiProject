			<p>A computer is a device that can perform computations and make logical decisions phenomenally
				 faster than human beings can. Many of today's personal computers can perform billions of
				  calculations in one second&mdash;more than a human can perform in a lifetime. Supercomputers are already
				  performing thousands of trillions(quadrillions) of instructions per second! To put that in perspective, a quadrillion-instruction-per-second computer can perform in one second more than 100,000 calculations for every person on the planet! And&mdash;these "upper limits" are growing quickly!</p>

				  <p>Computers process data under the control of sets of instructions called computer programs. These programs guide the computer through orderly sets of actions specified by people called computer programmers. The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software. In this book, you'll learn today's key programming methodology that's enhancing programmer productivity, theraby reducing software-development costc&mdash;object-oriented programming.</p>
